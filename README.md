abstract={This work presents FASTRL, a benchmark set of instrument manipulation tasks adapted to the domain of reinforcement learning and used in simulated surgical training. This benchmark enables and supports the design and training of human-centric reinforcement learning agents which assist and evaluate human trainees in surgical practice.},
